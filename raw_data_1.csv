2022-10-13 04:03:49+00:00,GaydaJinky,@momblogger Sandro Marcos is right. He is just trying to say that peso is not weak by itself. It becomes weak because it is compared to others (dollar) which is strong. But if you compare peso with other currency which has lower value than peso then you can say peso is strong.
